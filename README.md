# Data Wraggling with Python

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to Data Wraggling techniques using Python. It covers various aspects of data manipulation, visualization, and analysis to gain insights from a given dataset. 

## Introduction
In this notebook, we explore fundamental data analysis techniques using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn. The notebook begins with data manipulation and exploration using Pandas, followed by visualization techniques with Seaborn.

## Setup
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## Notebook Content
The notebook includes the following sections:

### 1. Data Initialization
- Importing required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn
- Creating Pandas Series and DataFrame objects

### 2. Data Manipulation
- Working with missing values and date objects
- Creating and manipulating DataFrame objects
- Exploring DataFrame properties and data types

### 3. Data Wraggling
- Loading a dataset using Seaborn's built-in dataset (Titanic dataset)
- Sampling and filtering data
- Applying boolean indexing for data filtering
- Filtering data with multiple conditions

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook "Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb" using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute each code cell sequentially to follow along with the EDA techniques demonstrated.
4. Feel free to experiment with the code and apply the techniques to your own datasets.
